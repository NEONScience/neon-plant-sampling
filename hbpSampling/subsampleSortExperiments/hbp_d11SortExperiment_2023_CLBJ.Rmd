##  Goal
To determine the efficacy of subsampling various proportions of HBP samples at the D11 CLBJ site to reduce long sort times associated with removing OSD from current-year clipped biomass. **Subsampling is only evaluated in the context of clip harvests that do not require sorting to functional group** (i.e., non-peak biomass clips), because the subsample to total mass ratios will not apply to individual herbGroups.

##  Experimental Setup and Analyses

* Select n=10 plots (all plots for OAES), resulting in a maximum of n=20 `clipID` to test, due to both `exclosure = Y and N` for each plot. Random spatially-balanced plot locations, and locations of clipIDs within plots, will provide an unbiased estimate of biomass throughout the Tower airshed.

* For each `clipID` harvested in the field, test subsampling efficiency at various levels of sorting by creating subsamples (current-year + OSD) with the following percentages of the total `freshMass`:
    - 10%
    - 15%
    - 25%
    - 50%
    
    The sum of all the subsamples = 100%; that is, the fresh mass of the entire clip strip.

* When subsampling is employed, calculate dryMass as follows: `dM = fM * (ssDM/ssFM)`, where:
    - *dM* = dryMass of current-year biomass in the clipID (no OSD)
    - *fM* = total freshMass in the clipID (current-year + OSD)
    - *ssDM* = subsampleDryMass of current-year biomass in the subsample (no OSD)
    - *ssFM* = fresh mass of all biomass in the subsample (current-year + OSD)

* Compare `dryMass` results calculated via subsampling with `dryMass` obtained with no subsampling, and use mixed effects models to analyze results.

##  Procedure

1. Perform clip harvest in the field as normal, and bring clipped biomass back to the laboratory in cold storage as normal.

1. Identify up to n=20 clipIDs (n=10 for `exclosure = Y` and n=10 for `exclosure = N`), originating from each of the 10 plotIDs.

1. Thoroughly mix biomass from each `clipID` to homogenize as thoroughly as possible.
    a. For large amounts of biomass, and when there is more than one bag of biomass for a given `clipID`, use a large bag, box, tray or equivalent vessel to mix the biomass.

1. For each clipID, weigh and record to 0.01 g:
    a. **`freshMass`** = total fresh mass in the clipID (current-year + OSD).
    a. It is important that `freshMass` for the entire `clipID` and subsample fresh masses (below) are collected for a given `clipID` as close to each other in time as possible. That is, avoid weighing `freshMass` for a given `clipID` hours apart from the subsample fresh masses as water loss will affect the experimental results.

1. Based on the **`freshMass`**, calculate the desired subsample fresh masses for testing. For example, assuming **`freshMass`** = 100 g, the target subsample fresh masses are:
    a. 10% subsample --> 10 g
    a. 15% subsample --> 15 g
    a. 25% subsample --> 25 g
    a. 50% subsample --> 50 g

1. Label a coin envelope for each subsample above with the information below.
    a. **`subsampleTest`**: `10%, 15%, 25%` or `50%`
    a. **`clipID`**
    a. **`collectDate`**
    a. **`exclosure`**: `Y/N`

1. Weigh each fresh subsample created above (current-year + OSD), and record the information below.
    a. **`subsampleTest`**: as above
    a. **`clipID`**
    a. **`collectDate`**
    a. **`exclosure`**: `Y/N`
    a. **`subsampleFreshMass`**: To the nearest 0.01 g; for subsamples < 0.5 g total mass, weigh to the nearest 0.0001 g

1. Sort current-year biomass from OSD for each subsample, and place sorted, current-year biomass into the corresponding labeled coin envelope.
    a. Sorted OSD may be discarded at this point.

1. Dry subsamples until dry; minimum of 48 h @ 65 ËšC, track drying progress as normal.

1. Remove dry samples from the oven one at a time, and immediately weigh and record:
    a. **subsampleDryMass**: To the nearest 0.01 g; for masses < 0.5 g, weigh to the nearest 0.0001 g.

## Results: Mixed-Effects model analysis

1.  Models accounting for subsampling effect on **dryMass** and using **clipID** as a random effect (no need to use **exclosure** as a fixed effect since random effect accounts for variation across exclosure treatment).

**_Model: Data from eventID = "HBP.2023.CLBJ.18" only_**

```{r me-treatment-event18, echo = FALSE}

#   Mixed effects model for eventID = "HBP.2023.CLBJ.18" alone
m1ME <- lmerTest::lmer(formula = estDryMass ~ treatment + (1|clipID),
                       data = longDF %>% dplyr::filter(eventID == "HBP.2023.CLBJ.18"),
                       REML = FALSE)

summary(m1ME)
anova(m1ME)

```

**_Model: Data from eventID = "HBP.2023.CLBJ.34" only_**

``` {r me-treatment-event34, echo = FALSE}

#   Mixed effects model for eventID = "HBP.2023.CLBJ.34" alone
m2ME <- lmerTest::lmer(formula = estDryMass ~ treatment + (1|clipID),
                       data = longDF %>% dplyr::filter(eventID == "HBP.2023.CLBJ.34"),
                       REML = FALSE)

summary(m2ME)
anova(m2ME)

```

**_Model: Data from both eventIDs_**

``` {r me-treatment-alldata, echo = FALSE}

#   Mixed effects model for all data
m3ME <- lmerTest::lmer(formula = estDryMass ~ treatment*eventID + (1|clipID),
                       data = longDF,
                       REML = FALSE)

summary(m3ME)
anova(m3ME)

```
\pagebreak


2.  Null model, and using **clipID** as a random effect. Theoretically, if all subsampling results in the same dryMass as the full sort, the null model should be no different than the "treatment" model.

```{r me-null, echo = FALSE}

#   Check if NULL model better than model including "treatment"
m4ME <- lmerTest::lmer(formula = estDryMass ~ 1 + (1|clipID),
                       data = longDF,
                       REML = FALSE)

summary(m4ME)
anova(m3ME, m4ME)

```
\pagebreak


3.  Linear model, using treatment*exclosure, and no random effect.

```{r lm-exclosure-interaction-effect, echo = FALSE}

#   Linear model with interaction effect
m1LM <- lm(estDryMass ~ exclosure*treatment + eventID, data = longDF)
summary(m1LM)
anova(m1LM)

```
\pagebreak


### Summary of subsampling results

``` {r summary, echo = FALSE}

#   Create data frame of summary results: % difference of subsampling for total estimated dryMass relative to
#   dryMass from full sort
eventID <- c("HBP.2023.CLBJ.18", "HBP.2023.CLBJ.34")
ss10 <- c(-6.2, 3.6)
ss15 <- c(-0.6, 2.3)
ss25 <- c(2.6, 1.9)
ss50 <- c(2.1, 0.76)

results <- data.frame(eventID, ss10, ss15, ss25, ss50)

knitr::kable(results,
             caption = "Difference in estimated dryMass to total dryMass for subsampling (%)")

```


## Conclusions

Summary of D11 CLBJ results:

1. Random effect associated with **clipID** explains considerable variability in the data. See summary outputs for all mixed-effects models.
1. Summary output for Mixed Effects model indicates that D11 CLBJ Clip Strips can be subsampled at the 15% level for all bouts with **herbGroup** = ALL.
    - Comparing results from two separate bouts, estimates of dryMass using a 10% subsample are more variable relative to total dryMass from the full sort compared to other subsampling levels.
    - Estimated dryMass from the 10% subsample is significantly different than the full sort for eventID = "HBP.2023.CLBJ.34" (p = 0.05)
    - When eventIDs are analyzed separately (m1ME, m2ME), other subsamples are not significantly different than the entire sorted subsample (p > 0.22) --> go with 15% subsample.
    - With both eventIDs analyzed together, there are no differences between the full sort dryMass and estimated dryMass from subsampling (p = 0.74).
1. Effect of `exclosure*treatment`, as evaluated in standard linear model (m1LM):
    - Effect of `exclosure` is significant (p < 0.05).
    - Effect of `treatment` not significant (p = 0.99).
    - No detection of `exclosure:treatment` interaction effect (p = 0.99).
