##  Goal
To determine the efficacy of subsampling various proportions of HBP samples in D11 to reduce long sort times associated with removing OSD from current-year clipped biomass. **Subsampling is only evaluated in the context of clip harvests that do not require sorting to functional group** (i.e., non-peak biomass clips), because the subsample to total mass ratios will not apply to individual herbGroups.

##  Experimental Setup and Analyses

* Select n=10 plots (all plots for OAES), resulting in a maximum of n=20 `clipID` to test, due to both `exclosure = Y and N` for each plot. Random spatially-balanced plot locations, and locations of clipIDs within plots, will provide an unbiased estimate of biomass throughout the Tower airshed.

* For each `clipID` harvested in the field, test subsampling efficiency at various levels of sorting by creating subsamples (current-year + OSD) with the following percentages of the total `freshMass`:
    - 10%
    - 15%
    - 25%
    - 50%
    
    The sum of all the subsamples = 100%; that is, the fresh mass of the entire clip strip.

* When subsampling is employed, calculate dryMass as follows: `dM = fM * (ssDM/ssFM)`, where:
    - *dM* = dryMass of current-year biomass in the clipID (no OSD)
    - *fM* = total freshMass in the clipID (current-year + OSD)
    - *ssDM* = subsampleDryMass of current-year biomass in the subsample (no OSD)
    - *ssFM* = fresh mass of all biomass in the subsample (current-year + OSD)

* Compare `dryMass` results calculated via subsampling with `dryMass` obtained with no subsampling, and use mixed effects models to analyze results.

##  Procedure

1. Perform clip harvest in the field as normal, and bring clipped biomass back to the laboratory in cold storage as normal.

1. Identify up to n=20 clipIDs (n=10 for `exclosure = Y` and n=10 for `exclosure = N`), originating from each of the 10 plotIDs.

1. Thoroughly mix biomass from each `clipID` to homogenize as thoroughly as possible.
    a. For large amounts of biomass, and when there is more than one bag of biomass for a given `clipID`, use a large bag, box, tray or equivalent vessel to mix the biomass.

1. For each clipID, weigh and record to 0.01 g:
    a. **`freshMass`** = total fresh mass in the clipID (current-year + OSD).
    a. It is important that `freshMass` for the entire `clipID` and subsample fresh masses (below) are collected for a given `clipID` as close to each other in time as possible. That is, avoid weighing `freshMass` for a given `clipID` hours apart from the subsample fresh masses as water loss will affect the experimental results.

1. Based on the **`freshMass`**, calculate the desired subsample fresh masses for testing. For example, assuming **`freshMass`** = 100 g, the target subsample fresh masses are:
    a. 10% subsample --> 10 g
    a. 15% subsample --> 15 g
    a. 25% subsample --> 25 g
    a. 50% subsample --> 50 g

1. Label a coin envelope for each subsample above with the information below.
    a. **`subsampleTest`**: `10%, 15%, 25%` or `50%`
    a. **`clipID`**
    a. **`collectDate`**
    a. **`exclosure`**: `Y/N`

1. Weigh each fresh subsample created above (current-year + OSD), and record the information below.
    a. **`subsampleTest`**: as above
    a. **`clipID`**
    a. **`collectDate`**
    a. **`exclosure`**: `Y/N`
    a. **`subsampleFreshMass`**: To the nearest 0.01 g; for subsamples < 0.5 g total mass, weigh to the nearest 0.0001 g

1. Sort current-year biomass from OSD for each subsample, and place sorted, current-year biomass into the corresponding labeled coin envelope.
    a. Sorted OSD may be discarded at this point.

1. Dry subsamples until dry; minimum of 48 h @ 65 ËšC, track drying progress as normal.

1. Remove dry samples from the oven one at a time, and immediately weigh and record:
    a. **subsampleDryMass**: To the nearest 0.01 g; for masses < 0.5 g, weigh to the nearest 0.0001 g.
